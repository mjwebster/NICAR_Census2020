# Story ideas

## In early 2020:
* Areas that have lowest response rates. <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/2017/geo/roam.html">This map allows you to find communities or neighborhoods where you could focus your reporting.</a> The underlying data can be <a href="https://www.census.gov/topics/research/guidance/planning-databases.html"> downloaded from here.</a>

* Where should storm-displaced people be counted? Pew did <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2020/02/11/census-gives-opposite-advice-to-tornado-damaged-dayton-flood-ravaged-houston">this story recently.</a>

* How has federal funding (dictated by Census counts) been distributed? <a href="https://gwipp.gwu.edu/counting-dollars-2020-role-decennial-census-geographic-distribution-federal-funds">This study provides breakdowns by state</a>, including a spreadsheet showing the amounts distributed to each state from 55 large Census-guided federal expenditure programs in FY2016.<a href="https://gwipp.gwu.edu/sites/g/files/zaxdzs2181/f/downloads/CFD%20%235%20--%2055%20Large%20Census-guided%20Programs%20by%20State%20FY2016.xlsx">The spreadsheet can be downloaded here.</a>

## Early 2021:
* Redistricting

## Summer 2021 and beyond:
To be best prepared for these stories, get familiar with what the 2000 and 2010 Census (and more recent American Community Surveys) had to say about the cities, counties and other places in your area. Were there areas that were on the verge of becoming majority-minority? Were there areas just starting to diversify? What areas were seeing large declines or large increases? Having a good handle on what happened between 2000 and 2010 will help you be better prepared to identify the trends between 2010 and 2020 that are noteworthy and new.

* New on this Census, respondents identifying as black or African American will have the opportunity to identify their origin (i.e. Somali, Ethiopian, Haitian, etc.). Since there isn't prior data on this, the primary way to use it will to identify which subgroups are living in your communities, and identifying where there are dense pockets of them living will help point you to where you should be knocking on doors for interviews.
* Areas with biggest population gains/losses. Especially interesting areas to pay attention to are urban downtowns, <a href="https://www.wxpr.org/post/rural-counties-depopulating-while-urban-areas-grow-report#stream/0">rural areas</a>, the outer fringes of metro areas. But don't forget about the mid-sized cities outside metro areas because you might find some surprises.
* Did any of the places that had been losing population (as of the 2010 Census), turn it around?
* Aging. What places have the highest median age? (indicating high density of elderly) Are they struggling to provide enough services to the elderly? Or to find working-age people to take the jobs needed, especially those to support the elderly?
* Majority-minority areas. Certainly there were will be cities or counties around you that might have crossed this threshold in the past decade. 
* Diversity index. You can get some inspriation from the "Changing Face of America" project by USA Today in 2014. Here's one of the big stories on  <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/11/25/minnesota-school-race-diversity/18919391/">school diversity</a>, and here's a <a href="https://www.lohud.com/story/news/investigations/2014/10/22/diverse-yet-segregated/17690721/">local takeout from the diversity analysis.</a>. Also, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/10/21/diversity-index-data-how-we-did-report/17432103/">here's the methodology with directions for how to calculate the diversity index yourself</a> and a <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/nation/2015/03/18/17657383/">great video</a> USA Today compiled to explain the diversity index to the average reader.
* Segregation (dissimilarity index)
* Homeownerhip/renting trends
* Family structure
