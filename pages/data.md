Net undercounts and overcounts by state. Here are key bits from the Census Bureau notes: "Table 5 contains estimates of net coverage for the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Attachments 1 and 2 display estimates of net coverage for the 578 counties and the 282 places, respectively, with a total population greater than 100,000. This total population cutoff of 100,000 included the housing unit and group quarters population. These three tables share some features; We generated root mean squared error estimates in 2010 to capture the potential bias introduced from synthetic estimation. The root mean squared error provided an indication of how much error there might be in the 2010 estimates at these lower levels of geography.; For the 2000 estimates, we displayed the only measure of uncertainty that was available, the synthetic standard error, which does not capture the potential bias introduced from synthetic estimation. Hence, the 2000 measures of uncertainty may understate the error. None of the 2010 estimates showed a significant overcount or undercount. We displayed the Census 2000 results for reference. <a href="https://www.census.gov/coverage_measurement/pdfs/g03.pdf">Report is here</a>



## Mid-March 2020:
<a href="https://2020census.gov/en/response-rates.html">Find daily updates of the 2020 response rates</a> down to census tract beginning March 20 through end of June. They are supposed to expose an API as well.

## Feb-March 2021:
Redistricting File (P.L. 94-171). This contains race and ethnicity breakdowns for the whole population in each geography, plus the same breakdowns for the voting age population. It also contains one table identifying how many housing units are occupied or vacant.

## Summer 2021:
Demographic and Housing Characteristics File (DHC) will be where you find the bulk of the more interesting data tables. This replaces Summary File 1. There will be crosswalks available to help marry this new format back to 2010 data.

Demographic Profiles: Select demographic and housing characteristics compiled in easy-to-use tables (multiple topics in each table). 


## Access options:
* <a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/">data.census.gov</a>. This is the site that has replaced American FactFinder. It allows you to find data from the Decennial Census, American Community Survey and other census products and then download a file you can open in Excel. 

* <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html">Access data via an API</a> Use programming languages such as Python or R to access data via the Census Bureau's APIs. For example, there are R packages designed to help you with this, such as tidycensus and censusapi.
