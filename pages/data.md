## Feb-March 2021:
Redistricting File (P.L. 94-171). This contains race and ethnicity breakdowns for the whole population in each geography, plus the same breakdowns for the voting age population. It also contains one table identifying how many housing units are occupied or vacant.

## Summer 2021:
Demographic and Housing Characteristics File (DHC) will be where you find the bulk of the more interesting data tables. This replaces Summary File 1. There will be crosswalks available to help marry this new format back to 2010 data.

Demographic Profiles: Select demographic and housing characteristics compiled in easy-to-use tables (multiple topics in each table). 


## Access options:
* <a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/">data.census.gov</a>. This is the site that has replaced American FactFinder. It allows you to find data from the Decennial Census, American Community Survey and other census products and then download a file you can open in Excel. 

* <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html">Access data via an API</a> Use programming languages such as Python or R to access data via the Census Bureau's APIs. For example, there are R packages designed to help you with this, such as tidycensus and censusapi.
